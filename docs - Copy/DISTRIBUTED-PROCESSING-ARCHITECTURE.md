# Distributed System Architecture - Processing Load Distribution

## Strategic Component Allocation

### Design Philosophy

**CRITICAL**: System-level components (WiFi, Mesh, Telemetry) are attached to the **torso subsystem** because:

1. **Head has high real-time processing demands** (displays, audio)
2. **Torso has processing headroom** for system coordination
3. **Separation of concerns** - Head focuses on expression, Torso manages system

### Load Balancing Principles

1. **System tasks  Torso** (Master coordinator has headroom)
2. **Real-time rendering  Head** (Dedicated high-frequency processing)
3. **Servo control  Local subsystem** (Minimize mesh latency)
4. **Telemetry aggregation  Torso** (Central collection point)
5. **Behavior planning  Torso** (High-level coordination)

### hitCount Tuning Guidelines

| Component Location | Task Type | hitCount | Rationale |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Torso System | WiFi Status | 50 | 5-second check sufficient |
| Torso System | Mesh Coordination | 10 | 1-second node management |
| Torso System | Telemetry Publish | 75 | 7.5-second MQTT cycle |
| Head Hardware | Eye Display | 5 | 500ms = 2 FPS (sufficient for expressions) |
| Head Hardware | Mouth Display | 3 | 300ms = 3.3 FPS (smooth speech) |
| Head Hardware | Audio Output | 7 | 700ms audio chunk updates |
| Arm Hardware | Servo Control | 10 | 1-second position updates (smooth motion) |

### CPU Budgeting

```
Total Loop Period: 100ms (10 Hz base rate)

Torso ESP32-S3 (240 MHz dual-core):
 Core 0: System tasks (WiFi, Mesh, Telemetry) = 25%
 Core 1: Servo control + Coordination = 25%
 Total: 50% utilized, 50% headroom 

Head ESP32-S3 (240 MHz dual-core):
 Core 0: Display rendering (SPI) = 40%
 Core 1: Audio processing (I2S) + Sensors = 35%
 Total: 75% utilized, 25% headroom (acceptable)

Arm ESP32-C3 (160 MHz single-core):
 Core 0: 7x Servo control + IK solver = 60%
 Total: 60% utilized, 40% headroom 
```

## Summary

**Key Design Decisions**:

1.  **System components attached to torso** - Torso has processing headroom
2.  **Head focuses on real-time rendering** - No system overhead
3.  **Strategic load distribution** - Each subsystem optimized for its role
4.  **Mesh architecture** - Torso master coordinates all slaves
5.  **Component isolation** - Clean separation of concerns

**Benefits**:

- **Head performance maximized** - 75% CPU for displays/audio
- **Torso has expansion capacity** - 50% headroom for future features
- **System reliability** - Watchdog and health monitoring centralized
- **Network efficiency** - Single WiFi/mesh coordinator
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new ESP32-C3 slave nodes
