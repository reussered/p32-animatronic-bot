## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **The Old Goblin's Journey**

**Week 1:** "Bah! Another abandoned project... probably won't even compile..."  
**Week 2:** "Wait... it's actually WORKING?! The components are talking to each other!"  
**Future:** "CURSE THESE BLINKING LIGHTS! And why is everything so LOUD?!"

## üé≠ **Technical Architecture Evolution**

### **Component System Design**
- **v1.0** (Week 1): Monolithic concept
- **v2.0** (Week 2): Individual component files for memory analysis ‚úÖ
- **v3.0** (Future): Full hardware integration per component
- **v4.0** (Future): Multi-ESP32 subsystem distribution

### **Memory Analysis Capability**
The component-per-file architecture enables precise measurement of:
- Individual component RAM/Flash footprint
- Animation cache impact per mood
- Driver overhead per subsystem type
- Scalability for multi-robot deployments
