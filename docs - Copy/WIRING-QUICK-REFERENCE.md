## Nose Sensor Wiring (4 wires)

```
Sensor Pin  ESP32 GPIO  Wire Color

TRIG        GPIO 25     Purple

GND         GND rail    Black
```

## Critical Safety Notes

```
  DISPLAYS USE 3.3V ONLY - 5V WILL DESTROY THEM!
  GPIO 34 IS INPUT-ONLY - PERFECT FOR ECHO PIN
  POWER OFF BEFORE CONNECTING/DISCONNECTING
  CHECK POLARITY - VCC/GND REVERSED = DAMAGE
  MAX CURRENT: 500mA (USB 2.0 limit)
```

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

**Display Not Working?**
- Check VCC is 3.3V (NOT 5V!)
- Verify GND connected
- Confirm SCK, SDA, RST shared between both eyes
- Check DC, CS unique per eye

**Sensor Not Detecting?**
- TRIG = GPIO 25 (output)
- ECHO = GPIO 34 (input only)
- Try 5V on VCC if available
- Point sensor forward (no obstructions)

**ESP32 Resetting?**
- USB cable quality (not charge-only)
- Current draw OK (~150mA total)
- No short circuits
- Breadboard connections solid
