# Session End Documentation Guide

## üéØ Purpose

Create **layered documentation** that preserves all knowledge but loads efficiently for new agents.

---

## üìä Three-Tier Documentation System

### Tier 1: Quick Resume (REQUIRED - Max 100 lines)

**File naming:** `QUICK-RESUME-[DATE].md`

**Contents:**
- Current issue/task (3 sentences max)
- Immediate next steps (numbered list, max 5 items)
- Critical files modified
- Quick command to resume work

**Example:**
```markdown
# Quick Resume - Oct 16

## Issue: LED blinks too fast
Loop speed faster than expected. Added diagnostic.

## Next Steps:
1. Run: pio run -t upload -t monitor
2. Read delta value from serial
3. Update hitCount in JSON
4. Regenerate tables

## Modified: src/components/simple_core_test.cpp
```

---

### Tier 2: Full Session Report (REQUIRED - Detailed but organized)

**File naming:** `SESSION-END-[DATE]-[TOPIC].md`

**Contents (use these exact sections):**

#### 1. Executive Summary (5-10 lines)
```markdown
## Session Summary
**Date:** [DATE]
**Duration:** [TIME]
**Status:** [Complete/In Progress/Blocked]
**Issue:** [One sentence]
**Resolution:** [One sentence or "In progress"]
```

#### 2. Problem Analysis (As needed)
```markdown

#### 4. Knowledge Gained (CRITICAL - Never skip!)
```markdown

```

#### 5. Next Agent Instructions (REQUIRED)
```markdown

[What to read first - links to other docs]

### Step-by-Step
1. [Concrete action]
2. [Expected result]
3. [Next action]

```

#### 6. File Inventory
```markdown
## Modified Files
- `path/to/file.ext` - [Brief description of changes]
- `path/to/file2.ext` - [Brief description of changes]

## Created Files
- `path/to/new/file.ext` - [Purpose]

## Files Needing Review
- `path/to/file.ext` - [Why it needs attention]
```

---

### Tier 3: Reference Documentation (Update as needed)

**Permanent knowledge bases** - update these when you learn something fundamental:

- `docs/LESSONS-LEARNED-BUILD-ERRORS.md` - Add new build errors
- `.github/AI-AGENT-RULES.md` - Add new ironclad rules
- Architecture specs - Update when design changes

---

## üöÄ Session End Checklist

When ending a session, create:

1. ‚úÖ **Quick Resume** - 50-100 lines, immediate context
2. ‚úÖ **Full Session End** - Comprehensive, well-organized
3. ‚úÖ **Update START-HERE.md** - Point to your new docs
4. ‚úÖ **Update relevant permanent docs** - If you learned something fundamental

## üéì Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Keep Quick Resume under 100 lines
‚úÖ Use clear section headers in Full Session End
‚úÖ Include commands in code blocks
‚úÖ Link to related docs
‚úÖ Document mistakes (future agents need this!)
‚úÖ Include file paths with changes
‚úÖ Write concrete next steps

### DON'T:
‚ùå Put everything in one giant file
‚ùå Skip the Quick Resume (next agent needs fast context!)
‚ùå Forget to document mistakes
‚ùå Use vague language ("might need to...", "probably...")
‚ùå Include entire file contents (just the relevant snippets)
‚ùå Skip the "why" (explain reasoning, not just what)

---

## üí° The Philosophy

**Knowledge Preservation ‚â† Loading Everything At Once**

- Preserve ALL hard-won knowledge (in Full Session End)
- Make it accessible on-demand (via Quick Resume + START-HERE)
- Layer information by urgency (Quick ‚Üí Full ‚Üí Reference)
- Let agents load context as needed (not all upfront)

**Result:** Fast startup + Complete knowledge + No token overflow

---

## üìû Questions to Ask Yourself

Before ending session:

1. ‚úÖ Can next agent resume in 5 minutes with Quick Resume?
2. ‚úÖ Is all knowledge preserved in Full Session End?
3. ‚úÖ Did I document mistakes for future agents?
4. ‚úÖ Are next steps concrete and testable?
5. ‚úÖ Did I update START-HERE.md?
6. ‚úÖ Did I update permanent knowledge bases if needed?

---

**Remember:** You're not just documenting for yourself - you're teaching the next agent!
