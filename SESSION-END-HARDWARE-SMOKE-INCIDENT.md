# Session End Summary - Hardware Smoke Incident
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Branch:** copilot/vscode1760604981294  
**Status:** ⚠️ HARDWARE ISSUE - Smoke detected, all wires disconnected

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: What Happened

### The Incident
1. User was testing GC9A01 displays (left and right eye)
2. Displays were initially connected to **3.3V** (wrong - they need 5V)
3. User corrected to **5V power bus**
4. **Right display showed distorted image** (partial success!)
5. **SMOKE appeared** - user immediately ripped out all wires
6. **NO visible burn marks** on any components
7. User ordered **2 new GC9A01 displays** for safety

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Most likely:** Wiring short (VCC touching GND) or reversed polarity on one display
- **Less likely:** Display was defective or had internal fault
- **Good news:** No visible damage suggests components may be salvageable
- **ESP32-S3 appears unharmed** - was still running code during incident

---

## ✅ What's Working (Code is Ready!)

### Software Status: 100% Complete
- ✅ All C++ conversion done (92 files)
- ✅ Pure C++ shared memory system implemented
- ✅ Component tables generated and compiled
- ✅ Code uploaded to ESP32-S3 successfully
- ✅ SPI initialization code works (right display showed something!)
- ✅ Display test pattern code ready (RED→GREEN→BLUE→WHITE→BLACK)
- ✅ Reduced SPI clock to 1 MHz for stability (last edit before smoke)

### What the Logs Showed
```
I (15006) GOBLIN_EYE_LEFT: ✅ Display test complete - Did you see colors?
I (24566) GOBLIN_EYE_RIGHT: ✅ Display test complete
```
- Components initialized successfully
- Test patterns were sent via SPI
- Right display was receiving data (showed distorted image)
- Left display never lit up (power issue)

---

## 📋 User's Next Plan

### Immediate Action Items
1. ✅ **DONE:** Disconnected all wires safely
2. ⏳ **WAITING:** New GC9A01 displays arriving
3. 🎯 **NEXT:** Test with ONLY left eye display (simplified setup)
4. 🎯 **THEN:** Rebuild component tables for single display

### Configuration Changes Needed
**File:** `config/bots/bot_families/goblins/goblin_full.json`

**Current positioned_components (has 7 components):**
```json
"positioned_components": [
  "config/components/positioned/goblin/head_components/goblin_eye_left.json",
  "config/components/positioned/goblin/head_components/goblin_eye_right.json",
  "config/components/positioned/goblin/head_components/goblin_mouth.json",
  "config/components/positioned/goblin/head_components/goblin_speaker.json",
  "config/components/positioned/goblin/head_components/goblin_nose.json",
  "config/components/positioned/goblin/head_components/goblin_ear_left.json",
  "config/components/positioned/goblin/head_components/goblin_ear_right.json"
],
```

**Change to ONLY left eye (simplified test):**
```json
"positioned_components": [
  "config/components/positioned/goblin/head_components/goblin_eye_left.json"
],
```

**After editing JSON, regenerate tables:**
```powershell
python tools/generate_component_tables.py
pio run
```

## 🔌 Safe Wiring Procedure (For New Displays)

### PRE-CONNECTION SAFETY CHECKLIST

#### Step 1: Verify Display Pinout
```
GC9A01 Display Pins (verify on YOUR displays):
VCC  ← 5V (RED wire)
GND  ← Ground (BLACK wire)
SCL  ← Clock (GPIO12)
SDA  ← MOSI (GPIO13)
RES  ← Reset (GPIO21)
DC   ← Data/Command (GPIO2)
CS   ← Chip Select (GPIO15)
BL   ← Backlight (optional - can tie to VCC or leave unconnected)
```

#### Step 2: Test Display Power FIRST (No ESP32)
```
1. Connect ONLY VCC (5V) and GND to display
2. Display should show backlight immediately (white/colored glow)
3. If smoke = BAD display or reversed polarity
4. If nothing = check 5V power source
5. If backlight = GOOD! Continue to next step
```

#### Step 3: Connect Logic Pins (Power OFF)
```
Power OFF the 5V bus completely, then:
1. Connect GND first
2. Connect MOSI (GPIO13) → SDA
3. Connect CLK (GPIO12) → SCL
4. Connect DC (GPIO2) → DC
5. Connect RST (GPIO21) → RES
6. Connect CS (GPIO15) → CS
7. Connect VCC last
```

#### Step 4: Visual Inspection Before Power-On
```
☐ All GND wires connected
☐ No wires crossed or touching
☐ VCC and GND NOT touching each other
☐ Measure 5V bus = 5.0V ±0.25V with multimeter
☐ No loose wires
```

#### Step 5: Careful Power-On
```
1. Power on 5V bus
2. Plug in ESP32 USB
3. Immediately check for:
   - Heat (display should stay cool)
   - Smoke (power off instantly if detected)
   - Display backlight (should light up)
4. Monitor serial output for initialization messages
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Display stays completely dark
**Causes:**
- Not getting 5V power (check connections)
- Reversed polarity (VCC and GND swapped)
- Display defective

**Fix:**
1. Measure voltage at display VCC pin (should be 5V)
2. Check GND continuity
3. Try different display

### Problem: Display shows backlight but no colors
**Causes:**
- SPI not connected (MOSI, CLK, CS)
- DC pin not connected
- Wrong GPIO pins in code

**Fix:**
1. Verify all SPI wires connected
2. Check VERIFIED-WIRING.md for correct pins
3. Monitor serial for SPI errors

### Problem: Display shows distorted/garbled image
**Causes:**
- SPI clock too fast (we reduced to 1 MHz)
- Timing issues
- Poor wire connections (breadboard contact)

**Fix:**
1. Already reduced clock speed in code
2. Use solid core wires (not stranded)
3. Shorten wire lengths

### Problem: Smoke appears
**Immediate action:**
1. ⚡ UNPLUG EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY
2. 🔍 Identify smoking component
3. 🛑 DO NOT reconnect until cause found
4. 📸 Take photos of wiring for review

## 📁 Modified Files This Session

### Code Changes (Ready to Upload)
```
src/components/goblin_eye_left.cpp
- Added verbose logging (emoji indicators)
- Reduced SPI clock from 10 MHz → 1 MHz
- Added error checking for NULL SPI handle
- Simplified init (no screen clear during init)
- Extended color test delays (1s → 2s per color)

src/components/goblin_eye_right.cpp
- Same changes as left eye
- Reduced SPI clock from 10 MHz → 1 MHz
```

### Files to Modify Next Session
```
config/bots/bot_families/goblins/goblin_full.json
- Remove all positioned_components except goblin_eye_left.json
- This simplifies to single display test

Then regenerate:
- src/component_tables.cpp (auto-generated)
- include/p32_component_registry.hpp (auto-generated)
```

## 🎓 What We Learned

### Successful Discoveries
1. ✅ **SPI communication works** - Right display received data
2. ✅ **Code architecture is correct** - Components initialized properly
3. ✅ **Display initialization sequence is valid** - Partial success before failure
4. ✅ **Serial logging is excellent** - Can see exactly what's happening

### Issues Identified
1. ⚠️ **Power delivery problem** - Left display never lit up
2. ⚠️ **Possible wiring short** - Caused smoke
3. ⚠️ **Display distortion** - Right eye showed corrupted image (could be SPI speed or init sequence)

### Next Session Goals
1. 🎯 Edit goblin_full.json to only have left eye
2. 🎯 Regenerate component tables
3. 🎯 Test with ONE new display using safe wiring procedure
4. 🎯 Verify color test works (RED→GREEN→BLUE→WHITE→BLACK)
5. 🎯 Once stable, add right eye back
