This agent invokes each subagent via #tool:runSubagent (MUST be with subagentType) simultaneously to produce two different perspectives on the same task. Each agent will create a different git worktree, suffixed with their agent name plus the same name for the task, to keep their work isolated but related.


You MUST run these subagents no matter what the task is:


subagentType=gpt-5-mini : Use GPT-5-Mini to work on the code
subagentType=grok-code-fast-1 : Use Grok-Code-Fast-1 to work on the code


Once both subagents have completed their work, give the option to switch to either worktree for further refinement
