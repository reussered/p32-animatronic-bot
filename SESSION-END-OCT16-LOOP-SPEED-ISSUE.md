# Session End Summary - October 16, 2025 Evening
**Status:** 🔧 Debugging loop speed issue - LED blinking 10x per second instead of 1x per second

---

## 🚨 CURRENT PROBLEM

### Issue Description
- ESP32-S3 is running the simple LED blink test
- **Expected:** LED blinks once per second (1 Hz)
- **Actual:** LED blinks ~10 times per second
- Serial monitor is getting spammed with blink messages
- User frustrated because hitCount changes aren't fixing the issue

### What We Tried
1. ✅ Set hitCount to 120000 in `simple_core_test.json`
2. ✅ Regenerated component tables with `python tools/generate_tables.py simple_test_bot src`
3. ✅ Verified `p32_component_tables.cpp` shows `120000` in hitCountTable
4. ❌ **Problem persists** - still blinking 10x/second

### Root Cause Analysis
**The loop is running MUCH faster than expected.**

**Expected loop speed:** ~120,000 iterations/second (based on documentation)
**Actual loop speed:** Unknown - need to measure with diagnostics

The formula is:
```
Execution frequency = loop_speed / hitCount
If hitCount = 120000 and frequency = 10 Hz, then:
loop_speed = 120000 × 10 = 1,200,000 iterations/second
```

**This means the loop is running 10x faster than documented!**

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED THIS SESSION

### 1. Main.cpp Stays Immutable ✅
- I mistakenly tried to add a delay to main.cpp
- User corrected me: **main.cpp runs at maximum speed with NO DELAY**
- Reverted the change immediately
- This is documented in `docs/CORE-LOOP-SPEC.md`

### 2. Added Loop Speed Diagnostic ✅
Updated `src/components/simple_core_test.cpp` to measure actual loop delta:

```cpp
extern "C" void p32_comp_simple_core_test_act(void)
{
    static uint64_t last_loop = 0;
    uint64_t loops_elapsed = g_loopCount - last_loop;
    last_loop = g_loopCount;
    
    // Toggle LED and log with delta measurement
    s_led_state = !s_led_state;
    gpio_set_level(s_led_gpio, s_led_state ? 1 : 0);
    
    if (s_led_state) {
        ESP_LOGI(TAG, "🔆 ON  - Loop: %llu (delta: %llu) - GPIO%d", 
                 g_loopCount, loops_elapsed, s_led_gpio);
    } else {
        ESP_LOGI(TAG, "⚫ OFF - Loop: %llu (delta: %llu) - GPIO%d", 
                 g_loopCount, loops_elapsed, s_led_gpio);
    }
}
```

**This will show the actual number of loops between each blink!**

---

## 📋 NEXT AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Build and Upload with Diagnostics
```powershell
pio run -t upload -t monitor
```

### Step 2: Read the Serial Output
Look for messages like this:
```
🔆 ON  - Loop: 1234567 (delta: 120000) - GPIO48
⚫ OFF - Loop: 2468901 (delta: 120000) - GPIO48
```

**The `delta` value tells you the ACTUAL loop speed!**

### Step 3: Calculate Correct hitCount
```
Desired frequency: 1 Hz (1 blink per second)
Correct hitCount = measured_delta × desired_frequency

Example:
If delta shows 1,200,000:
hitCount = 1,200,000 × 1 = 1,200,000
```

### Step 4: Update JSON Config
Edit `config/components/test/simple_core_test.json`:
```json
"timing": {
  "hitCount": [USE_MEASURED_VALUE],
  "description": "Blink LED every 1 second (measured actual loop speed)"
}
```

### Step 5: Regenerate and Test
```powershell
python tools/generate_tables.py simple_test_bot src
pio run -t upload -t monitor
```

### Step 6: Verify
- LED should now blink exactly 1x per second
- Serial messages should appear every 1 second

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION

### Configuration
- `config/components/test/simple_core_test.json`
  - Changed hitCount from 300000 → 10 → 120000
  - Updated description

### Code (Diagnostic Added)
- `src/components/simple_core_test.cpp`
  - Added `static uint64_t last_loop` to track previous loop count
  - Added `loops_elapsed` calculation
  - Modified logging to show delta value
  - This will reveal the actual loop speed

### Reverted Changes
- `src/main.cpp`
  - I mistakenly added FreeRTOS delay - **REVERTED**
  - Main loop is back to maximum speed (NO DELAY)
  - This is correct per architecture spec

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Lesson: Main.cpp is IMMUTABLE
**I violated this rule and got corrected.**

From `docs/CORE-LOOP-SPEC.md`:
> The main loop runs at MAXIMUM SPEED with NO DELAYS.
> Timing is controlled ONLY via hitCount values.
> NEVER modify main.cpp under ANY circumstances.

**Next agent:** If you're tempted to add delays, DON'T. Adjust hitCount instead.

### Lesson: Document Assumptions Are Wrong
The documentation says loop speed is ~120k/sec, but actual measurements show it's ~10x faster.

**Action needed:** Update architecture docs with actual measured loop speed once verified.

### Lesson: Measure Before Adjusting
Instead of guessing hitCount values, we should:
1. Measure actual loop speed first
2. Calculate correct hitCount from measurements
3. Document the actual speed for future reference

## 🔍 THEORY: Why Is Loop So Fast?

### Possible Explanations

1. **CPU Clock Higher Than Expected**
   - ESP32-S3 runs at 240 MHz (documented)
   - But effective loop speed depends on instruction count per iteration
   - Fewer instructions = faster loops

2. **Compiler Optimizations**
   - PlatformIO may be using aggressive optimization flags
   - Loop body is very small (just modulo check + function call)
   - Could be heavily optimized

3. **Documentation Was Wrong**
   - Original estimate of 120k/sec may have been based on:
     - Different hardware
     - More complex loop body
     - Different compiler settings

### How to Verify
Check `platformio.ini` for optimization flags:
```ini
build_flags = 
    -O2  ; or -O3, -Os, etc.
```

Higher optimization = faster loops.

**I will:**
1. Know about the diagnostic code added to simple_core_test.cpp
2. Upload and read the delta values from serial
3. Calculate correct hitCount
