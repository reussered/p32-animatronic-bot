2. SPI bus (Orange/Yellow/White)  Bundle together
3. Unique signals (Green/Blue)  Separate from SPI
4. Sensor signals (Purple/Gray)  Avoid crossing SPI

## Next: Flash Firmware

Once wiring is complete, proceed to firmware testing:

1. **Compile test firmware** (minimal display + sensor test)
2. **Upload to ESP32-S3** via USB
3. **Watch serial output** for initialization messages
4. **Verify displays** show test patterns
5. **Test sensor** readings in serial monitor
6. **Validate mood system** responds to sensor input

**You're ready to bring your goblin to life!**
