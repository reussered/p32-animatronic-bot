## Risk Analysis

### Manufacturing Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Servo supplier discontinues model** | Medium | High | Dual-source servos, design adapter brackets |
| **Display backorder (6+ months)** | Medium | High | Stock 6-month inventory, alternate suppliers |
| **Injection mold defects** | Low | High | Prototype thermoforming first, validate design |
| **Battery regulations change** | Low | Medium | Design for modular battery (swap chemistries) |
| **3D print quality issues** | Low | Low | Multiple printer fleet, backup printers |

### Market Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Insufficient demand** | Medium | High | Start with pre-sales, validate market first |
| **Competitor launches similar product** | Medium | Medium | Move fast, establish brand, open-source community |
| **Economic downturn** | Low | Medium | Target institutional buyers (less price sensitive) |
| **Technology obsolescence** | Low | Low | Modular design allows component upgrades |

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Tooling investment fails** | Low | High | Prototype with 3D printed molds first |
| **Inventory stuck (unsold units)** | Medium | Medium | Pre-sales model, make-to-order initially |
| **Cost overruns** | Medium | Medium | Conservative cost estimates, 20% contingency |
| **Funding shortfall** | Low | High | Bootstrap with pre-sales, avoid VC dependency |

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **$500 COGS target is achievable at 100-500 unit volume**

‚úÖ **$2,000 retail price supports 77% gross margins**

‚úÖ **77% margin supports R&D, marketing, and scaling**

‚úÖ **Business model validated: viable path to profitability**

**Recommended Path**:
1. Build 10 prototypes ($8,770 investment)
2. Pre-sell 50 units to fund tooling ($100,000 revenue)
3. Hit $455 COGS at 100-500 unit volume
4. Scale to 1,000+ units with 80%+ margins
5. Expand product family (Hobgoblin, Orc, Cyclops)

**Key to Success**: Move fast, validate with customers, optimize manufacturing at each scale milestone.

üìò **Next Steps**:
1. Finalize 4ft Goblin prototype design
2. Build and test first prototype
3. Document build process for replication
4. Launch pre-sales campaign (target: 50 units)
5. Use pre-sales to fund injection mold tooling
