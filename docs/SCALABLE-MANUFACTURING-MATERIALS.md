# Scalable Manufacturing Materials - Cost Analysis by Size

## Problem Statement

**3D printing works for 4-foot goblin, but becomes prohibitively expensive for larger creatures:**
- 5-foot Hobgoblin
- 6-foot Orc
- 7-foot Cyclops

Need cost-effective alternative materials and manufacturing methods.

## 3D Printing Cost Analysis (PLA)

### Material Cost Breakdown

**Base Parameters**:
- PLA filament: $20/kg typical price
- Print density: 15% infill (structural parts)
- Wall thickness: 3mm (4 perimeters @ 0.4mm nozzle)
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Print speed: ~50mm³/s (average)

### Cost by Creature Size

| Creature | Height | Skull Volume | Body Shell | Total PLA | Material Cost | Print Time | Electricity |
|----------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **Goblin** | 4 ft | 800 cm³ | 2,500 cm³ | 495g | **$10** | 48 hrs | $7 |
| **Hobgoblin** | 5 ft | 1,400 cm³ | 4,000 cm³ | 810g | **$16** | 78 hrs | $12 |
| **Orc** | 6 ft | 2,100 cm³ | 6,000 cm³ | 1,215g | **$24** | 117 hrs | $18 |
| **Cyclops** | 7 ft | 3,000 cm³ | 8,500 cm³ | 1,725g | **$34** | 166 hrs | $25 |

**Cost Calculation**:
- Solid volume × 0.15 (infill) + surface area × 3mm (walls)
- PLA density: 1.25 g/cm³
- Material cost: weight × $20/kg
- Print time: volume / (50mm³/s × 3600s/hr)
- Electricity: time × 150W × $0.15/kWh

### Total Cost per Creature (3D Printing Only)

```
Goblin (4 ft):      $17  ✅ ACCEPTABLE
Hobgoblin (5 ft):   $28  ⚠️ MARGINAL
Orc (6 ft):         $42  ❌ TOO EXPENSIVE
Cyclops (7 ft):     $59  ❌ WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
```

**And this is JUST the outer shell!** Not including:
- Electronics (~$150-200)
- Servos (~$200-400)

## Practical Considerations

### Workshop Requirements by Method

| Method | Space | Ventilation | Power | Safety Gear |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **3D Print** | Small | None | 120V/5A | None |
| **EVA Foam** | Medium | Moderate* | Heat gun | Respirator* |
| **Fiberglass** | Large | Critical | 120V | Respirator, gloves |
| **Vacuum Form** | Large | Moderate | 240V/20A | Heat-safe gloves |
| **Cardboard** | Small | None | None | None |

\* Only when heat-forming (burning foam fumes)

### Skill Learning Curve

```
EASIEST → HARDEST

1. Cardboard/Paper Mache (2 hours to learn basics)
2. 3D Printing (1 week to dial in settings)
3. EVA Foam (2 weeks to master heat-forming)
4. Vacuum Forming (1 month + equipment setup)
5. Fiberglass Layup (2 months + safety training)
```

### Time to First Unit

| Method | Setup Time | First Unit | Second Unit |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **3D Print** | 1 day | 5 days | 5 days |
| **EVA Foam** | 2 hours | 3 days | 3 days |
| **Fiberglass** | 2 weeks | 1 week | 3 days |
| **Vacuum Form** | 1 week | 3 days | 4 hours |
| **Hybrid** | 1 week | 1 week | 4 days |

## Cost Summary - Complete Creature

### 4-Foot Goblin (3D Printed)
- Shell: $17 (PLA)
- Frame: $150 (80/20)
- Electronics: $180 (ESP32, displays, sensors)
- Servos: $220 (3 neck + 3 spine + 14 limb)
- Power: $120 (battery, regulators, wiring)
- **TOTAL**: **$687**

### 6-Foot Orc (EVA Foam Hybrid)
- Shell: $185 (EVA foam body)
- Face: $24 (3D printed skull front)
- Frame: $300 (heavier-duty 80/20)
- Electronics: $250 (more sensors, bigger displays)
- Servos: $450 (larger, higher-torque)
- Power: $200 (bigger battery, higher current)
- **TOTAL**: **$1,409**

### Savings: **$722 saved by using EVA foam over scaled-up 3D printing!**

If we 3D printed the 6-foot Orc shell:
- Shell: $42 + $300 (extra structure) = $342
- vs EVA: $185 + $24 = $209
- **Savings**: $133 on shell alone

But the REAL savings:
- 3D print time: 117 hours machine time
- EVA foam: 30 hours hand work (can do other tasks while glue dries)
- **Time savings**: 87 hours of machine availability

## Production Scaling Strategy (Future)

### 3D Printed Molds → Injection Molding/Thermoforming

**User's Strategic Insight**: Use 3D printing for **tooling** instead of **parts**.

**Workflow**:
1. **Prototype phase**: 3D print parts directly (validate design)
2. **Tooling phase**: 3D print molds from validated design
3. **Production phase**: Use molds for injection molding or thermoforming
4. **Detail phase**: 3D print small details (faces, decorative elements)

**Key Advantages**:
✅ **Mold cost**: $50-150 (3D printed) vs $5,000-20,000 (machined aluminum)  
✅ **Per-part cost**: $3-8 (molded) vs $17-59 (3D printed)  
✅ **Production speed**: 2-5 minutes per part vs 50-170 hours  
✅ **Detail retention**: Excellent (captures 0.1mm features from 3D print)  
✅ **Material options**: ABS, PP, PETG, TPU (better than PLA for durability)  

**Services to Research**:
- **Xometry** - Quote injection molding with 3D printed molds
- **Protolabs** - Low-volume injection molding (1,000+ units economical)
- **Alibaba manufacturers** - Chinese injection molding (10,000+ units)
- **Local thermoforming shops** - PETG/ABS sheets over 3D printed bucks

**Cost Breakpoint Analysis**:
- **1-10 units**: Direct 3D printing is cheapest ($17/unit)
- **10-100 units**: EVA foam or vacuum forming ($8-15/unit)
- **100-1,000 units**: Injection molding with 3D printed molds ($3-8/unit)
- **1,000+ units**: Injection molding with aluminum molds ($1-3/unit)

### Mold Conversion Workflow (Scaling to Dozens/Hundreds)

**The same STL files serve multiple purposes:**

```
DESIGN PHASE (OpenSCAD):
    ↓ Generate STL
PROTOTYPE (1-10 units):
    ↓ Print parts directly on FDM printer
TOOLING PHASE (10-100 units):
    ↓ Convert STL → negative mold (boolean subtract)
    ↓ Print molds on FDM printer (solid infill)
    ↓ Coat molds with epoxy resin (smooth surface)
SMALL PRODUCTION (10-100 units):
    ↓ Thermoform PETG sheets over 3D printed molds
    ↓ OR vacuum form ABS
SCALING UP (100+ units):
    ↓ Send original STL files to injection molding company
    ↓ They create aluminum molds from your files
MASS PRODUCTION (1,000+ units):
    ↓ Injection mold at $1-3 per part
    ↓ Same design, industrial scale
```

**Key Insight**: Your OpenSCAD designs are production-ready from day one!

**Example: Goblin Skull Production Scaling**

| Quantity | Method | Tooling Cost | Per-Unit Cost | Total Cost |
|----------|--------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **1 unit** | Direct 3D print | $0 | $17 | $17 |
| **10 units** | Direct 3D print | $0 | $17 | $170 |
| **50 units** | 3D printed molds + thermoform | $150 | $8 | $550 |
| **100 units** | 3D printed molds + thermoform | $150 | $6 | $750 |
| **500 units** | Aluminum molds + injection mold | $5,000 | $3 | $6,500 |
| **1,000 units** | Aluminum molds + injection mold | $5,000 | $2 | $7,000 |
| **10,000 units** | Aluminum molds + injection mold | $5,000 | $1 | $15,000 |

**Breakeven Analysis**:
- 3D printed molds pay for themselves at **19 units** ($150 / $9 savings per unit)
- Aluminum molds pay for themselves at **357 units** ($5,000 / $14 savings per unit)

**Services for Production Scaling**:
1. **10-50 units**: DIY thermoforming with 3D printed bucks
2. **50-500 units**: Local thermoforming shop (send them your STL files)
3. **500+ units**: Xometry, Protolabs (upload STL, get quote for injection molding)
4. **5,000+ units**: Alibaba manufacturers (they create aluminum molds from your STL)

**No redesign needed** - the same clean_goblin_skull.scad file works at ANY scale!

**This approach deferred until production scaling is needed.**
